Let's start by bringing in our data
```{r}
datos <- read.csv("Trial7NoBG.csv")
```

Now let's get just our night data
```{r}
class(datos$Time.of.Day) #It's character
#And let's check to make sure there are only 2 categories
unique(datos$Time.of.Day) #Only day and night so we're perfect
noche <- datos[ which(datos$Time.of.Day == "night"), ]
dia <- datos[ which(datos$Time.of.Day == "day"), ]

#And now we check that dia didn't end up with any hours it shouldn't
unique(dia$Hour) #This one also appears not to be the problem.
```

Let's get the nighttime maxima for each chamber
```{r}
library(dplyr) #The package we need to find max by chamber

#Getting our new data
night.max <- noche %>%
  group_by(Chamber) %>%
  summarise(max = max(MO2.no.Background.Correction, na.rm=TRUE))
```
All negative so this is fine
